Je vindt het leuk om andere ontwikkelaars aan te sturen en te begeleiden, zodat zij beter worden in hun vak. Maar je zit ook graag bij klanten aan tafel. Je helpt ze om de juiste beslissingen te nemen, waarbij je techniek en business met elkaar in balans brengt. Of de voertaal nou Nederlands of Engels is, maakt niet uit: in beide talen voel je je prima op je gemak.<br><br><strong>Hoe ziet een dag eruit</strong><br>\nErgens in de ochtend. Je komt binnen in ons kersvers gerestylede kantoor in Amsterdam, high-fivet je collega\u2019s en pakt snel een kop koffie, want in de meetingroom zit al een sollicitant klaar. Het is een enthousiaste medior frontend developer, die heeft gereageerd op de recruitmentcampagne die je samen met een bureau hebt opgezet.<br><br>\nHet gesprek gaat fantastisch: al vanaf de eerste minuut weet je zeker dat je tegenover een rasechte Incentronaut zit. Hij is open, ondernemend, technisch goed onderlegd en blijkt ook nog eens uitstekend te kunnen windsurfen. Niet dat surfskills een vereiste zijn, maar het is altijd leuk als collega\u2019s een passie naast hun werk hebben. Je besluit om de kandidaat op staande voet aan te nemen, overlegt nog even met een collega en print dan meteen een contract uit. Handtekening erop en klaar!<br><br>\nAls dat geregeld is, loop je even naar de junior frontend developer die net uit de Young Professional Academy is gerold. Ze is bezig met een formulier dat al een tijdje op de backlog van een klant staat en vraagt zich af hoe ze ervoor kan zorgen dat de gebruiker de pagina kan vernieuwen zonder dat de ingevulde data verloren gaat. Je geeft net genoeg hints zodat ze zelf verder kan.<br><br>\nDan schuif je aan bij je collega met wie je samen een pre-salestraject doet. De uitdaging: een internationale klant wil zijn mijn-omgeving compleet migreren en restylen. Met als extra moeilijkheid dat de helft van de eindgebruikers in landen woont waar het internet nog geen topsnelheid bereikt. Je klant denkt aan een oplossing met Angular, maar jij weet zeker: deze klus schreeuwt om React. Samen met je collega bedenk je hoe je de klant van jouw advies gaat overtuigen.<br><br>\nDan is het lunchtijd, het hele kantoor neemt plaats aan de eettafel. Jij eet ook mee, maar wel een beetje snel omdat je straks naar een klant moet. Daar werkt een team van Incentro-frontenders en designers al twee maanden keihard aan een nieuwe website en jij wilt de refinement meemaken. Bovendien wil je de middag besteden aan het opzetten van Redux, waar je gisteren niet aan toe bent gekomen. Dus je houdt het bij een boterham en springt in de auto.<br><br>\nEenmaal bij de klant maak je eerst een praatje met je teamleden. Je wilt graag weten wat de status van hun werkzaamheden is en of ze je hulp ergens bij nodig hebben. Daarna sluit je aan bij de refinement. De klant heeft nieuwe user stories toegevoegd en jouw technische kennis is hard nodig om ze \u2018ready\u2019 te krijgen voor het team. Je spart met de designers, backenders en product owner en geeft aan waar nog informatie ontbreekt.<br><br>\nNa de refinement review je nog een pull-request op Github en schrijf je een stuk javascript voor een story die in de huidige sprint zit. Je wilt graag een voorzet doen zodat je teamlid ge\u00efnspireerd raakt en daarmee verder kan. De dag zit er alweer op. Morgen weer een nieuwe!<br><br><strong>Dit kun je</strong><br>\nJe bent<strong> meer dan 3 jaar</strong> aan het <strong>coden </strong>en hebt ervaring met:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>agile software development</strong>;</li>\n    <li>Continuous Integration en Continuous Delivery (Docker, Jenkins);</li>\n    <li>andere disciplines binnen het domein, zoals analytics, A/B-testing en performance;</li>\n    <li>samenwerking met UX-teams.</li>\n</ul><p><br>\nEn als wij deze termen noemen, weet jij precies wat we bedoelen:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS </strong>en <strong>Javascript</strong>.</li>\n    <li>\n<strong>Node.js</strong> en <strong>REST-services</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Javascript-frameworks zoals <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React </strong>en <strong>Vue</strong>.</li>\n    <li>\n<strong>CSS preprocessors</strong> (SCSS) en <strong>CSS</strong>-<strong>architectuur </strong>(SMACSS, BEM).</li>\n    <li>\n<strong>GIT</strong>, <strong>NPM</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>, <strong>Gulp</strong>.</li>\n    <li>Responsive Design en Mobile First;</li>\n    <li>Unit en end2end-testing (bijvoorbeeld Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Karma).</li>\n</ul><p><br><strong>Werken bij Incentro</strong><br>\nIncentro is niet zomaar een IT-bedrijf.

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>\n\n<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn\u2019t be restricted by geography.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What You\u2019ll Be Working On</strong></p>\n\n<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We\u2019ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>\n\n<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we\u2019ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO\u2019s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>\n\n<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>\n\n<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it\u2019s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it\u2019s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>React &amp; React Native</li>\n<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>\n<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>\n<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>\n<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>\n<li>Ruby on Rails</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Pandas</li>\n<li>Serverless</li>\n<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>\n</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don\u2019t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p>\n\n<p>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we\u2019ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p>\n\n<p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It\u2019s worked pretty well for the us the last few years.

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p>\n\n<p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p>\n\n<p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn\u2019t be restricted by geography.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What You\u2019ll Be Working On</strong></p>\n\n<p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We\u2019ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p>\n\n<p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we\u2019ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO\u2019s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </p>\n\n<p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </p>\n\n<p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it\u2019s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it\u2019s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>React &amp; React Native</li>\n<li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li>\n<li>Elixir,  Phoenix, and Nerves</li>\n<li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li>\n<li>Ethereum / Solidity</li>\n<li>Ruby on Rails</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Pandas</li>\n<li>Serverless</li>\n<li>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</li>\n</ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don\u2019t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This Role:  Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p>\n\n<p>Over the past few years, we\u2019ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well. \nWe value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p>\n\n<p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a holacracy. It\u2019s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to Extreme Programming as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don\u2019t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner.
