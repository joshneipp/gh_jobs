We seek developers who place a high value on continuous learning, and value diversity. If you consider yourself a non-dogmatic engineer, have a thirst for learning, and an eye for process, you\u2019re in great company. </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to leave our clients functioning at a higher level than when we found them.  We do this by writing high quality code alongside them, and by mentoring their developers, product teams and stakeholders in software development best practices. </p>\n\n<p>We believe that practices like Test Driven Development, Pairing and Refactoring are the foundation of a high functioning software team. And, we believe that not all Agile practices provide equal value to all teams at all times. So, we approach each engagement as the unique opportunity it is. </p>\n\n<p>As a Strider, you\u2019ll find an opportunity that\u2019s unmatched. You will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be part of an engineering-driven culture, one that has a 4.9 star Glassdoor review and that\u2019s won Crain\u2019s Best Places to Work 2 years in a row.</li>\n<li>Write high-quality code with some of the smartest engineers in town.</li>\n<li>Mentor Stride and client engineers.</li>\n<li>Immerse yourself in a learning journey that\u2019s second to none.

As a Strider, you\u2019ll work onsite at your client. We are proud to call some of NYC\u2019s most outstanding tech teams our clients, from startups to enterprise.  </p>\n\n<p>You will be part of a Stride team, on a client engagement. Your work week will involve 70%-80% client work, including coding, and mentoring Agile engineering best practices. The rest of your time will be spent on things like: managing Striders, being the engagement lead on your client, owning company-level initiatives, being a thought leader.</p>\n\n<pre><code>                                                     Here\u2019s how a day might unfold:\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>9am: One-on-one meeting with the client\u2019s CTO.  I\u2019m the engagement lead on my client. I meet with the CTO weekly. We go over the plans for the week and give each other feedback. I take notes so I can relay the info to the team. </p>\n\n<p>10am: Daily Standup. Standup lasts 5 minutes and then we\u2019re off to code.</p>\n\n<p>10:10-12:30 Pair Programming. This morning, I\u2019m pairing with another Strider. She\u2019s been coding 3 years, and she\u2019s got strong fundamentals. We\u2019re doing a deep dive into complex backend code. I\u2019m asking questions when I see she gets stuck. She notices a refactoring opportunity and we jump in. </p>\n\n<p>12:30-1:30 Lunch with my team Every Strider gets a company AmEx. We\u2019re encouraged to grab lunch, coffee with our team and/or client to get to know each other. We talk business for 30 minutes and the rest of the time we talk about rock climbing and a new strategy board game Derek bought last week.</p>\n\n<p>1:30-4:00 Pair Programming</p>\n\n<p>4- 5:Sprint Retrospective Retrospectives on my team are amazing.

Seven of us are taking the DevOps Jam course, it\u2019s 1 hour weekly, for 8 weeks.  DevOps is something I\u2019m dipping a toe in and having a safe space to learn real world stuff that I can bring back to my client is great. </p>\n\n<p>6pm: Leave for the Day.
